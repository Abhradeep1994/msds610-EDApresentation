# Exploratory Data Analysis

**By**: Ensun, Steven and Abhradeep

This repository contains our group presentation for our MSDS 610: Communication for Analytics course, where we are presenting our views on EDA and it's importance.

## Introduction

## Goal 
For this presentation we wanted to highlight the importance of EDA and showcase some basic EDA that we can implement have a better understanding of our data. 

## The Data
The dataset we chose to work with is the [Cars dataset](https://github.com/Abhradeep1994/msds610-EDApresentation/blob/main/cars.csv). This dataset contains  a total of 393 rows and four variables which are:
- MPG
- Cylinder
- Engine 
- Weight

## Our Process

### Data Processing 
Cleaning and Identifying data types

### Bar Plots


#### Scatter Plots    


#### Other Plots


### Conclusion



Thank you for taking the time to read about our presentation on EDA. We hope you realized the importance of EDA and why a data scientist should do good EDA before taking any decision or steps
