# Exploratory Data Analysis

**By**: Ensun, Stephen and Abhradeep

This repository contains our group presentation for our MSDS 610: Communication for Analytics course, where we are presenting our views on EDA and it's importance.

## Introduction

## Goal 
For this presentation we wanted to highlight the importance of EDA and showcase some basic EDA steps that we can implement to have a better understanding of our data. 

## The Data
The dataset we chose to work with is the [Cars dataset](https://github.com/Abhradeep1994/msds610-EDApresentation/blob/main/cars.csv). This dataset contains  a total of 392 rows and four variables which are:
- MPG
- Cylinder
- Engine 
- Weight

## Our Process

### Data Processing 
- Collecting basic information regarding the data:

    - Data types
    - Missing Values
    - Treatment of missing values(There can be other ways, we are replacing the missing values with the median value of that variable)

### Plots

#### Histogram:
Histograms are plotted to check the distributions of the variables in our dataset.

### Conclusion



Thank you for taking the time to read about our presentation on EDA. We hope you realized the importance of EDA and why a data scientist should do good EDA before taking any decision or steps
