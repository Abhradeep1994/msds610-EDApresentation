#### Here are notes from our discussion points last Tuesday (Sep 27)

**Dataset**

- Consider using "cereals" dataset.

**Visualizations to use**
- Scatter plot
- Histogram
- Box plots

**Techniques to show**
- Detection of null values in variables in the dataset
- Simple statistics of variables in the dataset
